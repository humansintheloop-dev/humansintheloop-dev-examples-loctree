I want a GoLang TUI application that takes a directory of source code as an argument.

It will show the total LOC in the directory.

I can expand a directory and it will show the LOC for each subdirectory

I can expand subdirectories recursively to see more details.

I can also collapse directory to hide the details.

The each directory is shown as LOC directory name.

The subdirectories are indented.
